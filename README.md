# UDRayfield
Before I explain it, I would like to say I didn't make this, and all credits go to the orgirnal devs (credits at top of script). The orignal script is at ```https://docs.sirius.menu/rayfield``` aswell.

# So, what is this?
Well, it's rayfield but undetected. As the script I work for uses rayfield, but is detected in some games.

# Can I use this?
Well it's not even mine, so yeah.
